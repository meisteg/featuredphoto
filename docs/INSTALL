# INSTALL for Featured Photo
# $Id: INSTALL,v 1.13 2008/03/30 14:18:19 blindman1344 Exp $


===== IMPORTANT =====

This version of Featured Photo requires phpWebSite 1.5.0 or higher. You
have to install phpWebSite >= 1.5.0 first - earlier versions of phpWebSite
will not work. If you are running phpWebSite 0.10.x, grab the latest 0.x.x
version of this module.

If you don't have phpWebSite installed, first get the latest code here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15539

Then follow the install instructions found in the INSTALL file included in
the docs directory of that download.

In addition, for upgrades only, you must have Featured Photo 1.1.0 or later
installed.  Upgrades from 1.0.x are no longer supported.

Once this is done then you can start installing Featured Photo.


===== INSTALLATION =====

1. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE.  Never install this or any other module without
   doing this.

2. Download the .tar.gz or .zip file from sourceforge and unpack it.

3. Move the new directory into your phpwebsite mod directory.

    Example: If your phpwebsite directory is /home/httpd/htdocs, you would run:

    mv featuredphoto /home/httpd/htdocs/mod/featuredphoto

4. Go to your phpWS website and install or upgrade "Featured Photo" from the
   Boost module.

5. Log out and log back in to your site to reset your environment before
   using the module.

   The module is now installed.  You can get there by going to "Control Panel"
   and clicking on "Content".


===== UPGRADING FROM FEATURED PHOTO 0.x.x =====

Version 1.0.4 was the last version to include the Feature Photo conversion
script.  You will need to use that version to convert from Featured Photo 0.x.x.
After completing the conversion, you can upgrade to this version.
