IMPORTANT: Featured Photo is a module for phpWebSite 0.10.1 or higher.  You
have to install phpWebSite >= 0.10.1 first - Featured Photo will not work with
earlier versions of phpWebSite. If you don't have phpWebSite installed,
first get the latest code here:

https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15539

Then follow the install instructions found in the INSTALL.txt included
in the docs directory of that download.

Once this is done then you can start installing Featured Photo:

1. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE.

2. Download the .tar.gz or .zip file from sourceforge and unpack it.

3. Move the new directory into your phpwebsite mod directory.

    Example: If your phpwebsite directory is /home/httpd/htdocs, you would run:

    mv featuredphoto /home/httpd/htdocs/mod/featuredphoto

4. Go to your phpWS website and install or upgrade "Featured Photo" from the
   Boost module.

   The module is now installed.  You can get there by going to "Control Panel"
   and clicking on "Site Content".
